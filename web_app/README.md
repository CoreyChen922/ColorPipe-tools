ColorPipe-tools Web App
========================

** Developments under progress **

Use PlotThatLut and LutLab tools through a browser.

For now, only basic features of PlotThatLut are available.


Requirements
------------
- Python
- matplotlib
- OpenColorIO Python binding
- CherryPy
- mako

Web app usage
-------------
You can test quickly in local by :  
- setting up your environnement ($PYTHONPATH, ...).  
- creating img and uploads directories.  
- and then launching :  
`python app.py`

For deeper usages, you'll have to customize your own cherryPy config (see server.conf).
