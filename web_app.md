Another goal of ColorPipe-tools is too provide a user-friendly alternative to command-line.

For now, only PlotThatLUT is integrated in this web app.

You can test it quickly in local by :

* setting up your environnement ($PYTHONPATH, ...).
* creating img and uploads directories.
* going in web_app directory and then launching :

`python app.py`

For deeper usages, you'll have to customize your own cherryPy config (see server.conf).
