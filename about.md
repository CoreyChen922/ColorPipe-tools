ColorPipe-tools is a set of tools to handle and process LUTs or color spaces.
This project is in line with [ColorPipe blog](http://colorpipe.mikrosimage.eu/en/).


It includes : 

**PlotThatLUT**


Based on [OpenColorIO](http://opencolorio.org/), PlotThatLut allows to plot a LUT to understand its color transformation.
If itâ€™s a 3D LUT, it displays a cube; if its a 1D LUT, a curve.

PlotThatLUT is available as a command line tool or as a web service.

**LUTLab**


Also based on [OpenColorIO](http://opencolorio.org/), LUTLab gathers a set of scripts to convert LUTs or color spaces.

For now, LUTLab is only available in command line but is intended to become part of a web service.
